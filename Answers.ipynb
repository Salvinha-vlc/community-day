    "There is also statistical significance to state that vomit color, blood type o, poo consistency and exposure type depend on having the cholera disease or not. Which it allows us to trace additional cause-effect relationships with our target variable. For instance, we are confident to state that poo consistency and vomit color changes with the cholera disease."
